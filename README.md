This software was created as part of my third year research project for my bachelor's degree in Swansea University. It is a C#-based application that can make removing some of the Windows bloatware and data-hungry services easy for novice users. It comes with two "modes":

* Easy Privacy; get guided through the removal with information about what data is collected
* Advanced; selectively/bulk remove Windows applications

This project may not get updated frequently in future, but it should work for the applications it currently supports for the forseeable future.

### Built With
The software is coded primarily in C# but takes advantage of the PowerShell scripting language for the removal of the applications. Development started in Visual Studio, but moved to JetBrains Rider.
